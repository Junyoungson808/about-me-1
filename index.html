      <h2>Welcome!</h2>

      <h3>A little bit about me</h3>

      <p> Hello, and thanks for visiting my website. I'm Liliane, a software developer and current student at Code Fellows. I'm originally from Southern California but moved to the Seattle area a few years back, as I felt drawn to the PNW atmosphere: lots of rainy weather, strong coffee, and greenery everywhere. And with Seattle being such a tech hub, it only felt natural to make a pivot in my career and learn to code. I'm currently in the Code Fellows 201 course, where we're learning how to design and create web applications from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I intend to specialize in Python, and with my new skills, I hope to create technology that improves the quality of people's lives and increases access to beneficial information and resources. When I'm not coding, you can find me perusing the fantasy section of the bookstore, trying out different yoga flows, going to a concert, tending to my vegetable patch, and brainstorming ideas for my next trip (the goal being to visit every continent eventually)! </p>
