      <h2>Welcome!</h2>

      <h3>A little bit about me</h3>

      <p> Hello, and thanks for visiting my website. I'm Liliane, a software developer and current student at Code Fellows. I'm originally from Southern California but moved to the Seattle area a few years back, as I felt drawn to the PNW atmosphere: lots of rainy weather, strong coffee, and greenery everywhere. And with Seattle being such a tech hub, it only felt natural to make a pivot in my career and learn to code. I'm currently in the Code Fellows 201 course, where we're learning how to design and create web applications from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I intend to specialize in Python, and with my new skills, I hope to create technology that improves the quality of people's lives and increases access to beneficial information and resources. When I'm not coding, you can find me perusing the fantasy section of the bookstore, trying out different yoga flows, going to a concert, tending to my vegetable patch, and brainstorming ideas for my next trip (the goal being to visit every continent eventually)! </p> 

      <h3>My Education</h3>

      <p> I received a bachelor's degree in Literature and Writing Studies and an MBA with a specialization in International Business from California State University San Marcos. I stay involved with the university and am on the executive committee of the Alumni Assosication. Now, I'm a student at Code Fellows and am pursuing a certificate in Software Development. </p>

      <h3>My Work Experience</h3>

      <p> I worked for about 5 years as a music instructor and taught the flute specifically. I would teach at several elementany and middle schools during the day, and after school, I would teach private lessons. It was such a joy teaching a child how to make their first sound on an instrument and witnessing their growth as musicians - and frankly, just as good human beings - over the years we'd work together. Afterwards, I made a shift into the recruiting field, where I've spent the last 5 years as an executive recruiter for a boutique search firm. I've hired for corporate, nonprofit, and government organizations, all of which come with their own complexities and challenges. It's been gratifying and interesting work, but now, I'm ready for a new direction and to embrace life as a programmer. </p>
