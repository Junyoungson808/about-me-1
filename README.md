1. **How did this go, overall?**
I think the lab overall went well. I believe I met the requirements, although at the time of submitting this, I haven't done any CSS work, so it's basically text on a page. 

2. **What observations or questions do you have about what you’ve learned so far?**
I would like to learn more if there's a more efficient way to make my prompts, such as with a loop.

3. **How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?**
It took me a couple hours, as I watched back part of the lecture video and followed along, and it took me some time to come up with the content for my paragraphs and my prompts. It took a little longer than I initially anticipated (but I'm finding that to be the case with most assignments).

1. **How did this go, overall?**
I enjoyed this lab. It was difficult to get some of the loops correct at first, but it was satisfying once they were working the way I intended.

2. **What observations or questions do you have about what you’ve learned so far?**
I'm curious to see how incorporating functions in future steps will make this process more efficient.

3. **How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?**
It took me a few hours to complete the assignment, and that's about how long I was anticipating.
